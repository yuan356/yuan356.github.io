			   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
			   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
			   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br><br>
		 
			   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
			   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
			   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
			   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
			   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
			   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
			   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br><br>
		 
			   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
			   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

			   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
			   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
			   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

			   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
			   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
			   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
			   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
			   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
			   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
			   as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>
			<p>
			4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
			   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
			   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
			   meet the following conditions:<br><br>
		 
			   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>
		 
			   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				   stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>
		 
			   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

				   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				   the Derivative Works; and<br><br>
		 
			   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
				   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				   as modifying the License.<br><br>
		 
			   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
			   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
			   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
			   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
			   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

			</p>
			<p>
			6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
			   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
			   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
			   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>
			<p>
			7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
			   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
			   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
			   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
			   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
			   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
			   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
			   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
			   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>
			<p>
			8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
			   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
			   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
			   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
			   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
			   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
			   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
			   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
			   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
			   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
			   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>
			<p>
			9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
			   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
			   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
			   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
			   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
			   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
			   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
			   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
			   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
			   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
			</p>
			<p>

                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to

                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
